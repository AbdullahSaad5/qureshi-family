        About Us
      </h1>
      <p>
        Genealogy is the hobby, the art and the science of exploring your family
        history, finding out who your ancestors were and where your family came
        from. The Internet has made it faster and easier by allowing many of us
        to quickly and easily find information about our ancestors, therefore
        our unique genealogy search engine, shajra.info , comes to your aid. You
        can also be a volunteer by assisting us in research of family genealogy.
        Simply share what you know or ask your family/elders for more. Don’t
        worry if you don’t have more facts, basic information (Name, Father
        Name, Status etc.) is enough for Add/Update Family Members. Our
        community is made of family history fans just like you.
